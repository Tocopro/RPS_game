    <h1>HOW TO PLAY ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS</h1>
    <!--------------paragraph describing how the game is played --------->

    <p id="text1">Play Rock Paper and ScissorsThe game is played with three <br>
        possible hand signals that represent a rock, paper, and scissors.<br>
        The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb<br>
        extended and the palm facing downward; and scissors is a fist with the <br>          
        index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player.<br> 
        Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins<br>
        against paper. If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered<br>
        a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner.
